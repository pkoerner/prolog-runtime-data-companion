The code and thesis were created by Christoph Ludolf as part of his bachelor's thesis.

## Overview

- Prolog/Benchmark/src/
  - contains .txt files which are descriptions for the benchmarking tool. Note that the pathes are written Windows-style (with a backslash rather than a forward slash).

- Prolog/Benchmark/results/
  - the raw data stored as .csv files gathered during the experiments
